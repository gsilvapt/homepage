  title: Laravel, PHP for Artisans
  speaker: fiskolini
  summary: |
    Laravel is a PHP application framework with expressive and elegant syntax,
    that attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks
    used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing,
    sessions, and caching.

    Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for
    large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container,
    expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support
    give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are
    tasked.
