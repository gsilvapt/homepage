date: 2022-10-29
location: Significa, Rua da Torrinha 154, Porto

summary: |
  Hacktoberfest is DigitalOcean’s annual event that encourages people to
  contribute to open source throughout October. Much of modern tech
  infrastructure relies on open-source projects built and maintained by
  passionate people who often don’t have the staff or budgets to do much more
  than keep the project alive. Hacktoberfest is all about giving back to those
  projects, sharpening skills, and celebrating all things open source,
  especially the people that make open source so special.

  Join us at Significa's office and let's work on our favorite open source
  projects. We will pitch some local open source projects and spend the day
  hacking together.

  Sign up at https://hacktoberfest.com and bring your computer with you.
