  title: Building static websites with Ember.js
  speaker: locks
  summary: |
    With the advent of server-side rendering for client-side frameworks like
    Angular/React/Ember, you can now use familiar tooling to develop your
    static websites. In my presentation I will be showing how to leverage
    ember-cli-staticboot and Ember's ecosystem to quickly put together a
    website.
