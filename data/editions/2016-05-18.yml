  summary: |
    Rui Lima led us through a journey through time, going into the history and
    evolution of PHP since version 5.3 to 7.0. The concept of
    [PSRs](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/) (PHP Standard Recommendations),

  title: Moving from PostgreSQL to RethinkDB
  speaker: guiferrpereira
  summary: |
    Nowadays, we need to ensure that applications are operating 24/7, and
    PostgreSQL (http://www.postgresql.org/) does not support master-master
    replication (only through third parties, with some limitations).

    With this in mind, I will talk about migrating an application from
    PostgreSQL (http://www.postgresql.org/) to RethinkDB
    (https://www.rethinkdb.com/). In a technical talk, I will present the
    issues I encountered, as well as a performance analysis between both
    databases.
