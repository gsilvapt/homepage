  title: Encrypted vs Private communications
  speaker: artur
  summary: |
    Is TLS-based communication really private? What apps do we use today that
    are private or just encrypted? Most of today's best practices of security
    are not enough for ensure that a system can be private, most
    implementations are not aware of third party leakage, like audio encoding,
    rely too heavily on common standards from the web. Other that try to mimic
    Signal, end up with what is called dumb-encryption, also known as "I'll do
    my own cypher algorithm". What are the insurances and caveats that can be
    present in a system need privacy on a M2M or P2P level? Something to find
    out in this talk!
