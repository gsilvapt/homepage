  summary: |
    In this talk, we’re gonna talk mobile development without using strictly
    native tools - and yes, these sorts of platforms usually result in apps
    that don’t quite nail the native look&feel, residing in an uncanny valley
    for applications. However, this one’s a little different.

    We're talking about React Native, a mobile development framework, created,
    developed and endorsed by Facebook you can plug right in your existing
    native code to gain developer superpowers: Hot Reloading, instant deploys
    without an AppStore round-trip, UI expressed in React components and many
    more! Facebook says it'll replace mobile development as we know it - so
    let’s see how true that might be!
