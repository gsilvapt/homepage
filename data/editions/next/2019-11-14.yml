  - title: A serveless case study with AWS
    speaker: luismiguel
    summary: |
      A full-fledged CMS can easily keep records of tasks input by users,
      process those tasks into a queue, communicate them to a job factory, and
      notify users of the results. We decided we didnâ€™t want to manage a full
      CMS just for that, going serverless was the perfect alternative.
  - title: How Ember.js revamped their infrastructure
    speaker: locks
    summary: |
      The Ember project has many associated websites, the guides, the
      deprecation guides, the blog, the API documentation, and the main website
      itself. These were built over the years as needed and used a mishmash of
      technologies (middleman, embedded Ember, standalone Ember), which made it
      hard for both maintainers and new contributors to the project. To take
      advantage of the Ember knowledge and skills in the community, we started
      moving projects to Ember. In this presentation I will be covering how we
      are using JAMstack practices to accomplish this migration.
