      Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by
      DigitalOcean and DEV. Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global
      community. To participate, you must submit four pull requests to public
      GitHub repositories.

      Join us in Porto i/o Santa Catarina and let's work on our favorite open
      source projects. We will pitch some local open source projects and spend
      the day hacking together.
