  - title: "Thriving through the hype cycle: an Ember.js story"
    speaker: locks
    summary: |
      The front-end development community has been through a fair share of hype
      cycles in the last ten years. In this time, we have seen libraries and
      frameworks come and go, sometimes even disappearing completely like
      batman.js.

      In this talk we will cover how the Ember.js project has managed not only
      to keep up with the hype cycles, but to continually push the framework
      and the web forward and bring its users along. We will close off the
      presentation by talking how this culminates in the concept of editions,
      the first of which is Ember Octane.
