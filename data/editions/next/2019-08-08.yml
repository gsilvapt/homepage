  speaker: tentone
  summary: |
    At UNO Digital we develop solutions for the oil and gas industry. One of
    our products is world scale visualization for geospacial data, point clouds
    and CAD models. This information is combined with asset management and
    monitoring data from our platform to create real time visualizations of
    production plants. In this talk we will present the challenges we faced
    while trying to deliver over 300GB of 3D data to the web at record time.
