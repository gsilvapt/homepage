title: Porto Codes presents Hacktoberfest
summary: |
  Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by
  DigitalOcean and DEV. Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global
  community. To participate, you must submit four pull requests to public
  GitHub repositories.

  Join us in Porto i/o Santa Catarina and let's work on our favorite open
  source projects. We will pitch some local open source projects and spend
  the day hacking together.
