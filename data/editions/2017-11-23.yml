  title: The Dream of Styleguide Driven Development
  speaker: SaraVieira
  summary: |
    React is awesome! We probably all here agree on that. You have heard of all
    types of driven development but react emerged a new type, styleguide driven
    development became a reality with components. This type of development
    focuses on Developer/Designer collaboration and on assertive components.
    With the use of React, CSS Modules, Flow and Snapshot testing we were able
    to almost remove style regressions. In this talk you get a glimpse of you
    can start styleguide driven development and how you can sell this dream to
    your project managers.
