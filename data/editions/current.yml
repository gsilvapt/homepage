  speaker: decioferreira
  summary: |
    Elm is a functional language for reliable webapps, with a very strong
    emphasis on usability, performance, and robustness.

    Elm compiles to JavaScript, and is most well known for:

    - No runtime errors in practice. No null. No undefined is not a function.
    - Friendly error messages that help you add features more quickly.
    - Well-architected code that stays well-architected as your app grows.
    - Automatically enforced semantic versioning for all Elm packages.

    By the end of this talk I hope you will be able to create your own web
    application in Elm, understand how it compares with other projects like
    React as a tool for creating websites and web apps, but also understand the
    core ideas and patterns that make Elm nice to use.
