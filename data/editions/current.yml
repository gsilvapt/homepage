  title: 'Implementing Grading System Soup-To-Nuts'
  summary: |
     Sooner or later each software development company approaches the point
     where it requires a grading system. The process of creating and
     implementing such systems requires a lot of effort and can easily fail at
     any stage because of various circumstances. My presentation will help
     engineering managers and C-level managers understand the basic pros and
     cons of such systems and give them algorithms for choosing between
     different approaches. From an individual contributor’s perspective, it
     might be useful for a better understanding of why companies have such
     systems and how they are created.
