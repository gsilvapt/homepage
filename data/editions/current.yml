  speaker: locks
  summary: |
    The front-end development community has been through a fair share of hype
    cycles in the last ten years. In this time, we have seen libraries and
    frameworks come and go, sometimes even disappearing completely like
    batman.js.

    In this talk we will cover how the Ember.js project has managed not only
    to keep up with the hype cycles, but to continually push the framework
    and the web forward and bring its users along. We will close off the
    presentation by talking how this culminates in the concept of editions,
    the first of which is Ember Octane.
