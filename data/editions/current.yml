  title: A serverless case study with AWS
  speaker: luismiguel
  summary: |
    A full-fledged CMS can easily keep records of tasks input by users,
    process those tasks into a queue, communicate them to a job factory, and
    notify users of the results. We decided we didnâ€™t want to manage a full
    CMS just for that, going serverless was the perfect alternative.

  title: How Ember.js revamped their infrastructure
  speaker: locks
  summary: |
    The Ember project has many associated websites, the guides, the
    deprecation guides, the blog, the API documentation, and the main website
    itself. These were built over the years as needed and used a mishmash of
    technologies (middleman, embedded Ember, standalone Ember), which made it
    hard for both maintainers and new contributors to the project. To take
    advantage of the Ember knowledge and skills in the community, we started
    moving projects to Ember. In this presentation I will be covering how we
    are using JAMstack practices to accomplish this migration.
