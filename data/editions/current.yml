  title: 'Thriving through the hype cycle: an Ember.js story'
  summary: |
    The front-end development community has been through a fair share of hype
    cycles in the last ten years. In this time, we have seen libraries and
    frameworks come and go, sometimes even disappearing completely like
    batman.js.

    In this talk we will cover how the Ember.js project has managed not only to
    keep up with the hype cycles, but to continually push the framework and the
    web forward and bring its users along. We will close off the presentation
    by talking how this culminates in the concept of editions, the first of
    which is Ember Octane.

  title: Using Kafka with a Microservices Architecture
  summary: |
    A Microservices Architecture can be a mishmash if we aren't careful to keep
    all the services decoupled from one another. Some concepts of Domain-driven
    design are powerful mechanisms to implement scalable services, and Apache
    Kafka provides us many features to support and implement these concepts.
