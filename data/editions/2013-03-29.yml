summary: |
  Speed talks: Please feel free to do a speed talk, it will be a very relaxed
  meetup (hence the 'Ice-breaker' name) so don't worry too much about time or
  the presentation itself.

  Dinner: Depending on the number of talks, we can either order some fast food
  or we can go and eat somewhere. We will see how it goes later.

  After drinks: After the meetup we can go and have drinks in Porto city :) --
  the rain doesn't help, and I know it's Easter time... so we also have to
  see what will be the mood of the people.

  One of the topics I would like us to discuss today is the state of the ruby
  community, I think we ought to organize ourselves... and thus, that will be
  my talk/discussion for later.
schedule:
- start: 19:00
