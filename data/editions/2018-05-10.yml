  title: Building a Testing Culture
  speaker: ordepdev
  summary: |
    We live surrounded by bad practices, stress, and fear of missing a delivery
    timeline. We all work or worked, on projects with those characteristics. If
    we don't enforce a shared culture of testing, no matter what, the quality
    of the software that we produce will suffer. With this talk/topic, I want
    to share the problems and solutions that will enable us to create a shared
    testing culture across our team and company.
- start: 20:30

    conversation.
