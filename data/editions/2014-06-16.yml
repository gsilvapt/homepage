summary: |
  At the behest of one of the RailsGirls Porto coaches (Maxim), I'm putting
  together a meetup so we can trade Rails war stories. The theme of the meetup
  is narrower since I'm trying to take it off the ground again, but we'll
  expand and diversify on the next ones.

  I know this was announced quite on top of the date, but I'll set up another
  one for the members that can't make it on Monday.

  P.S. Post's in english since we have non-Portuguese attendants.
