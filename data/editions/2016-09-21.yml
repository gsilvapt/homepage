  summary: |
    Sometimes you need to automate desktop capture, but how do you do it? Doesn’t
    video encoding have a big impact on performance? Aren’t most desktop capture
    applications GUI based?

    Doing desktop capture and encoding on windows with minimal performance impact
    can certainly be a challenge. Fortunately there are plenty of technologies and
    libraries to help us. In this talk we'll explore what’s out there and how an
    open source project helped us deliver a high quality solution.
