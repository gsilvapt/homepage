  summary: |
    When talking about programming languages, Swift is the new kid in Apple’s
    block. In this session we are introducing Swift from an iOS developer's
    perspective and how it helps build more reliable code compared to its
    ancestor Objective-C while crushing some myths along the way.

    But, is it mature enough? XCode. Using Swift in production and in building
    apps where Obj-c meets Swift.

    Now in version 2.2, we will also talk about where we are going and how open
    sourcing Swift enables for new interactions with the developer community
    such as language improvement and other applications of the language.
