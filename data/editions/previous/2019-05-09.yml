- title: Email me maybe
  speaker: punnie
  summary: |
    Build your own email server! First we'll see how email works both in theory
    and in practice, and the stuff you'll need before building your own server.
    We'll then go through the steps to build one ourselves, hopefully see it in
    action, and in the end we'll discuss a bit whether this is a good idea and
    some peculiarities you may find along the way.
