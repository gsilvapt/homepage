- title: Living inside GNU Emacs
  speaker: aadcg
  summary: |
    Today's technological world is both exciting and alarming.

    Exciting because we have the tools to solve the challenging problems of our
    overpopulated planet. The vision of a connected, peaceful and fair world
    feels closer than ever.

    Alarming because tech companies provide tons of malware that people greet
    without questioning - exchanging their freedom for a fake sense of pleasure
    and a fake sense of productivity.

    In this talk, I will show that GNU Emacs is the perfect environment for a
    focused and free life in a world full of corrupted people and bullshit.
