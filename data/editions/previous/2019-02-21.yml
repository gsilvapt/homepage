  summary: |
    React is one of the most used libraries for web development. However,
    because it's so widely used, the library evolves fast and sometimes we
    don't get the most out of it or we are not familiar with new patterns and
    best practices. This talk gives an overview of the current best practices
    and caveats to watch out for.
