  summary: |
    Nowadays, we need to ensure that applications are operating 24/7, and
    PostgreSQL does not support master-master replication (only through third
    parties, with some limitations).

    With this in mind, I will talk about migrating an application from
    PostgreSQL to RethinkDB. In a technical talk, I will present the issues I
    encountered, as well as a performance analysis between both databases.
