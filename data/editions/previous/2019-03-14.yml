  summary: |
    Home Automation seems to finally be spreading and
    growing, with a lot of new products getting to the
    market with affordable prices. Unfortunately, many of
    those products use their own proprietary interfaces, so
    we end up with isolated products that don't talk to
    each other, and that rely on cloud-based services
    (which may be unreliable or slow due to network
    conditions).

    Fortunately, there are many ways to make some of these
    proprietary products work locally, interact with each
    other and centralize them, allowing us to control and
    manage them from a single service, instead of using a
    different app for each device. In this talk, we will
    discuss some of the ways to do that using open-source
    software like Home Assistant. We will also take a look
    at some of the most common technologies used in Home
    Automation, and even how to get rid of proprietary
    firmware and use open-source ones!
