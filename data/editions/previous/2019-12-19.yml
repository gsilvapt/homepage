- title: Infrastructure as code using Terraform
  speaker: hugopeixoto
  summary: |
    We use git to keep track of what changes we do to our code, and why we do
    them. Some use Chef/Salt/Puppet to keep track of server installations. I
    use terraform to apply the same process to manage my AWS accounts, both
    personal and professional.

    This doesn't apply only to your standard cloud providers (AWS, GCP,
    Azure). I also manage resources on Heroku, Netlify, Fastly, GitHub,
    Gitlab, and other tools.
