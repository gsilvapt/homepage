- title: Implementing Grading System Soup-To-Nuts
  speaker: dmitryderbenev
  summary: |
    Sooner or later each software development company approaches the point
    where it requires a grading system. The process of creating and
    implementing such systems requires a lot of effort and can easily fail at
    any stage because of various circumstances. My presentation will help
    engineering managers and C-level managers understand the basic pros and
    cons of such systems and give them algorithms for choosing between
    different approaches. From an individual contributorâ€™s perspective, it
    might be useful for a better understanding of why companies have such
    systems and how they are created.
