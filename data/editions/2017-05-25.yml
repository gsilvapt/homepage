  title: Functional Programming in Modern C++
  speaker: miguelpoeira
  summary: |
    In this talk I'll try to show you how you can write functional-oriented
    code with modern C ++. Typically, C ++ is known as a language where you
    need to reinvent the wheel every time you start a new project. From simple
    examples to more complex metaprogramming, I'll try to convince you
    otherwise.
