  title: Knee Deep Into P2P
  speaker: justmendes
  summary: |
    What happens when you don't like centralized things? You do P2P! I created
    a distributed smart office using Elixir that runs in a single P2P network.
    There are a lot of subtleties into this. How can we prevent someone from
    entering the network? How do we manage shared data? What topology do we
    use? How about nodes that are unrealiable and we are not sure when they
    will connect or disconnect? What if YOU want to add a node and we can't
    trust you to deliver messages? I will use the office as an example and
    teach you how different the reasoning between a web-like centralised
    context and a P2P distributed system is. We will go from simple P2P
    topologies (gossip, trees) to more complex ones (Gnutella2, HyParView,
    Plumtrees), analyse their problems and take a look at what CRDTs are and
    how awesome they can be for shared data.
- start: 20:30
  title: Dinner + Santini (icecream)
  summary: |
    We will have dinner downtown, please let us know of any dietary
    restrictions so we can plan accordingly.

    Afterwards it is customary to go for icecream at Santini and continue the
    conversation.
