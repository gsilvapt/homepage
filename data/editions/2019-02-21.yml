  summary: |
    React is one of the most used libraries for web development. However,
    because it's so widely used, the library evolves fast and sometimes we
    don't get the most out of it or we are not familiar with new patterns and
    best practices. This talk gives an overview of the current best practices
    and caveats to watch out for.

    About Luís Cardoso:

    I've been a Frontend Engineer at Feedzai for 7 years. I'm on the company
    almost from it's beginning and I had a big role on what is the Frontend at
    Feedzai today (for good and bad). Some of the things I've been involved
    with: maintaining a large SPA, recruiting, architecture decisions and
    several initiatives inside the company. In my free time I'm an amateur
    photographer.
