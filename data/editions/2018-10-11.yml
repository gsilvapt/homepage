  title: Go 2 Draft Designs
  slides: /slides/2018-10-11.pdf
  speaker: dpinela
  summary: |
    One of Go’s most distinguishing features among modern programming languages
    is its fairly minimalistic feature set, which makes it particularly simple
    to read and write. Some of the omissions, however, have had definite
    drawbacks, most notoriously the inability to write type-generic functions
    and data structures and the large amounts of error-checking boilerplate.

    Recently, the core Go team has released a set of draft designs
    (https://golang.org/s/go2designs) for solutions to address these problems,
    in order to gather feedback from the community. We’ll explore the ideas
    they put forth and how they might change the way we write Go.
- start: 20:30
