          <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com">Hacktoberfest</a> is
          a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean
          and DEV. Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community.
          To participate, you must submit four pull requests to public GitHub
          repositories.
        </p>

        <p>
          Porto Codes is hosting two hacking sessions so that we can have some
          fun while working on open source together.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can contribute to any open source project you like. You can work
          on translations, documentation, fixing bugs or adding new features.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will be presenting open source projects by local communities and
          distribute some prizes. Bring your laptop and join us!
