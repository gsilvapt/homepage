      <section id="details">
        <h2>Topic and format</h2>

        <p>
          You can address any topic that is slightly related to the tech world.
          Talk about a favorite programming library, a new language you've been
          exploring, your hobby project.
        </p>

        <p>Do not advertise a product or company.</p>

        <p>Make it inclusive, avoid bad-mouthing other languages / communities.</p>

        <p>
          As a general rule, try to keep it between 10 and 30 minutes. If
          necessary, we can go up to 45 minutes. We want to keep everyone
          focused, and leave some time for questions afterwards.
        </p>

        <h2>What we need from you</h2>

        <p>
          <b>Before the event</b>, we will need the title of your talk and a
          short description. We will help you iterate on those, if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're using your own laptop, install <a href="https://obsproject.com">OBS</a>
          and make sure it is working properly. We will use it to record your
          screen during the talk.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>On the day of the event</b>, bring any adapters required to work
          with a 1080p HDMI projector. If you do not have a laptop or the
          necessary adapters, send us your presentation and we'll set it up
          using one of our own computers.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>After the event</b>, send us the presentation slides and the
          screen recording. We can get these from you right after the event, by
          providing a USB drive, or you can send it to us via dropbox/google
          drive.
        </p>

        <h2>What we provide</h2>

        <p>
          We have a 1080p projector with an HDMI cable, a clip-on microphone, a
          clicker with laser pointer.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're comfortable with it, we will record and publish the talk
          afterwards, assuming that we did not screw up the A/V.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will sponsor your dinner and ice cream after the event.
